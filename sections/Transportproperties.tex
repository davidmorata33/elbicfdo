\subsection{Properties of the flow}
\paragraph{}The properties of the flow have to be defined taking into account the hypotheses made for the case. Given that the flow is air, the kinematic viscosity \textit{nu} ($\nu$) is $1.5e^{-5} m^2/s$. Also, as mentioned previously, the simulation will work with a Newtonian flow and this has to be defined here as well.

\paragraph{}To change all these flow parameters and properties, the \textit{constant/transportProperties} file has to be modified as follows. There is no need to dedicate more time to this file since everything is really clear within it.

\paragraph{}Another hypotheses that has been made in order to alleviate the computation time is that the flow is laminar, although it would not be a very realistic flow in this case. To impose this condition, a modification has to be made in \textit{constant/turbulenceProperties} file.
