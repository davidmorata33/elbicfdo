\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
During the development of the subject of \textit{"Application of Open-Source CFD to engineering problems"} we have obtained knowledges in relation to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), open source and open foam. Initially was presented a list of different possible projects to perform as a group during the course and its subsequent delivery. After agreeing with the teacher,it was decided to choose a project outside this list and related to propulsive systems, specifically a jet engine. 

\paragraph{}
We have found interessant and useful  study this engine instead of other aerospace projects such as an airfoil because we are interested in propulsion systems and this project could give extra knowledges on this matter in view of a future TFG related to this subject. Furthermore, this engines is one of the most important  in the aerospace industry and it is used in planes sucha as Airbus A380 or Boeing 747.
